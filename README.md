# DrugDiscovery_ForCancer

The discovery of new drugs is a complex, resource-intensive process, particularly critical in the fight against cancer, one of the leading causes of death globally. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool to accelerate drug discovery. This research explores the use of ML techniques to identify potential anti-cancer drug candidates by analyzing large biological datasets. Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms are applied to genetic, proteomic, and chemical data to uncover patterns and predict molecule behavior and efficacy. Deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are utilized to interpret complex chemical structures, protein interactions, and biological markers, aiding in predictions of drug efficacy, toxicity, and off-target effects. Additionally, the study integrates molecular docking simulations with ML models to predict how well drug candidates bind to cancer-related proteins. The goal is to identify compounds with high binding affinity, low toxicity, and strong therapeutic potential for specific cancer types, enabling more targeted and personalized treatments. This approach has the potential to dramatically reduce drug development timelines, lower costs, and increase clinical trial success rates. Ultimately, ML-driven drug discovery could revolutionize cancer treatment by rapidly identifying more effective, patient-specific therapies.
